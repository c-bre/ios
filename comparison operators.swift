// comparison Operators
// 1 == 1  // Equal to, true because 1 is Equal to 1
// 2 != 1  // not Equal to, true because 2 is not Equal to 1
// 2 > 1  // Greater than, true because 2 is Greater than 1
// 1 < 2  // less than, true because 1 is Less than 2
// 1 >= 1 // Greater than or Equal to, true because 1 is Greater than or Equal to 1
// 2 <= 1 // Less or Equal, false because 2 is Not Less than or Equal to 1

print(1 >= 1) // Greater than or Equal to, true because 1 is Greater than or Equal to 1
